          B.S. thesis project
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          As B.S. thesis, Idesigned and implemented a gateway responsible for translating the two most-used protocols (standards) in the Smart Grid. Firstly, this gateway enablesold and new devices using different standards to exist, and cooperate in anoperational environment. Secondly, it is optimized and cost-efficient, which canbe developed and deployed with low financial investment.
